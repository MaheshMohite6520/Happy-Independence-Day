This project showcases an animated representation of the Indian flag using HTML and CSS. 
The Indian flag, also known as the "Tiranga," consists of three horizontal stripes of different colors: saffron, white, and green, 
with a navy blue Ashoka Chakra (wheel) with 24 spokes in the center. 
This animation project aims to replicate the flag's design with subtle waving motion.
